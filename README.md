# ✈️ British Airways Data Science Project – Data Scientist

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a data science job simulation focused on improving customer experience and sales strategies at British Airways. It involved building predictive models, web scraping customer reviews, and deriving actionable insights from customer behavior data.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and model customer buying behavior, uncover key pain points, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and business outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
  - Libraries: Beautiful Soup, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression & Decision Trees (scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Web scraping techniques
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

## 🔍 Key Tasks and Contributions
- Built a predictive model using **logistic regression and decision trees** to classify customer purchase likelihood.
- Scraped customer review data using **Beautiful Soup** to identify common themes in feedback.
- Processed and cleaned raw data, transforming it into a structured format suitable for modeling and visualization.
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to highlight patterns in customer satisfaction and pain points.
- Proposed data-backed strategies to enhance customer experience and improve conversion rates.

## 💡 Insights Generated
- Identified top factors influencing buying decisions, such as pricing, service quality, and ease of booking.
- Highlighted common complaints and satisfaction drivers from customer reviews.
- Recommended targeted marketing and UX improvements to optimize user journey and engagement.

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges Faced & How They Were Handled
- **Challenge:** Unstructured nature of scraped customer reviews.
  - **Solution:** Applied text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment tagging.

- **Challenge:** Selecting the right model for classification.
  - **Solution:** Performed model comparison using accuracy, precision, and recall scores to finalize logistic regression.
